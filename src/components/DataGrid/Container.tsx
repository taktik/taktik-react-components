       while the line stays hairline-thin. The handle itself paints nothing: it is an 8px
       transparent strip carrying the col-resize cursor, and its ::after draws the 2px line at
       the boundary. The same split every other seam in the app uses.

       ⚠ The strip has to sit ENTIRELY INSIDE the cell, because the cell clips
       (overflow: hidden) and a clipped strip is neither painted NOR hit-testable. Hanging it
       over the boundary — the obvious way to centre a seam on the edge it sits on — silently
       threw away half the target: measured, a 5px handle at right: -2.5px answered over 3px of
       screen, so aiming at a column boundary was a matter of luck rather than of pointing.

       The seam is discreet: the cursor is the affordance, the line only hints at it under the
       pointer and commits while the drag is on. :active is what says "dragging" — the handle
       takes pointer capture, so it keeps that state until the drag ends, wherever the pointer
       goes. --rdg-resize-handle-color lets a consumer name the tone; without one it is the
       grid's own border, the line the handle sits on. */

    /* The gradient rdg paints beside each pinned column is shown deliberately — a provisional
       design choice, history in flowr's admin-migration doc 25. Restyling it has no API either:
       the shadow elements carry no stable class, custom property or prop (upstream PR #3969), and
       the only handle is their shape — the sole children of .rdg with neither a role nor a
       measuring key — ⚠ the one selector here written against rdg's DOM rather than against a
       stable rdg-* name, so it wants a re-check on every react-data-grid bump. ⚠ Only Chromium
       hides the gradient while the grid cannot scroll (a scroll-state container query); other
       browsers paint it permanently.

       Its own gradient is kept, because each edge fades towards the middle of the grid and only
       rdg's own two generated classes tell the two directions apart. What is dialled down is the
       whole element: a filter multiplies the paint and leaves opacity alone, which matters because
       opacity is the property that scroll-state query drives — one of ours would win over it and
       leave a permanent band on a grid with nothing to scroll.

       Each edge is TWO elements, one over the header rows and one over the body, so no single
       mask can span the grid. The first stop sits at the header's own height, which is the whole
       of the header element: the header row carries no shadow at all, and the band eases in over
       the body's first rows and out again above its last, instead of ending square at both. */
